Encapsulation is combining the data and methods together to work efficiently.
it involves bundling data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit,
using encapsulation. we can set and get the data.
basically encapsulation is setter and getter in the project.
because of this we can maintain a security for the data like we make variables private and we set and get using encapsulation.
as variables are private so no one can access it outside of class so either user can set or get but it will not change directly outside of class.
