polymorphism is ability of an object to take many forms. it means same object works in may ways.
for live example : A person can have multiple roles: a mother, a daughter, a friend, an employee.
In Polymorphism we have two types
1. Static Polymorphism which means compile time polymorphism which can be achieved using method overwrite
2. Dynamic Polymorphism which means runtime polymorphism which can be achieved using method overriding

method overwrite : in same class but having different method signatures
method override : in different class having same method signature but inline implementation is different

Method Overriding
in this package we create base class called CarClass having one method carModel,
where it gets extended by TataCar class which has same overridden method carModel but having different implementation
now again TataCar gets extended by PunchCar class having same method carModel but different implementation
at last created ChildCarClass which extends PunchCar so its a multilevel inheritance.
using CarClass reference we call above all three class methods hence dynamic polymorphism we achieved

Method Overwriting
in same class ChildCarClass we created method named overWriteMethod having same name but different method signatures.
