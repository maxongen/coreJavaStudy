Abstraction means hiding implementation from user
here we can achieve abstraction using abstract class or interface
we create child class in which we can give reference of parent class using child class and call child class methods
for example
we created one interface named MobileParent in which we declared one printModel method
we implemented this interface to 2 child classes IphoneClass and SamsungClass where we override printModel
method and added some implementation in it
now we create another child class MobileChild which has no implement or extend of other class.
In this class we created reference object.
The reference of SamsungClass and IphoneClass given to MobileParent one by one and called printModel method.
When user trying to go to definition to this method it will redirect to interface as we created reference object.
